- Hello there, welcome to the third day of hunting challenge, today w'll be continues working on choosen target.
- yesterday, w've working on the `/wp-json/`
    - we arrived to the `/wp-json/wp/v2/users`
        - it's just reveal 2 users info that 99% don't affect to the application business.
        - doing dorking again and Boom, in the same `path` instead of useless data about just 2 users, I found information about the users in other domain that contains sensitive data, so trying to extract them, so check the domain to see it is a place to share them, so yes. :_ 
        - then it's not a security issue.
