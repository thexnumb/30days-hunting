# Day1 `13-Feb-2025`
- Hello everyone welcome to the No.2 of hunting challenge on bug bounty.
- Today is the Fourth day of my working on this target(2 last days of previous challenge is also), so I'll tell you tho whole proces of the work
- First of all reading all the policy
- Note down the all important things
- Next step is to configure Burpsuite to set in-scope and out-of-scope domains and assets
- so after doing the basics, now It's the time to kick the fire
- do a overview of all domains in a quick way and then write down interesting assets to start from it first (write on xmind)
- note that the program that I've choose is a Large Company with many previous Report (valid One)
- Let's start, Act like normal user on each domains
- Some Interesting assets found deep dive into one of them
- Start exploring on it and Boom, First vulnerability found on the `profile User Setting` for re-bind Google token after unlink it, but Immediately accept it as `informative`
- Another bug that found is to bypass phone number limitation, still is `pending`
- The rest of day Let's check another subdomains to increase attack surface
- arrive at an endpoint that struggling with account
  -  after trying some test, arrive to blog of the application
    -  in there we can see the blog posts and then the vote system of the blog is un-secure to vote unlimited to any post you want, this is too still is `pending`.
-  I think it's enough for today, till tomorrow happy hacking `:)`
