# Day2 `26-Mar-2025`
- Hello there, let's start!
- yesterday we work on specific domain with dorking and so on
- let's just do recon!
- as this company is a large one, so magic trick! ~ first read the wikipedia about the company :)
- then go to the [crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com), [tracxn](https://tracxn.com)
- wow so interesting, but take time :)
- One domain got my attention, so let's check it (sub recon -> dnsx on them and then service discovery on live subdomains)
