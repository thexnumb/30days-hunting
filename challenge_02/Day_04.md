# Day4 `17-Feb-2025`
- Hello there, welcome to the another day of hunting challenge, today w'll be continues working on choosen target.
- today still w'll gonna work on the recon phase and in the meanwhile trying some tests for interesting endpoints
- fun story, the Open Redirect that I've been found few day earlier, missed it and I'm so sad rn :P
- I found this Open Redirect but it's too noisy and blow my mind to can't handle the `referer` issue. :_
- arrive to an endpoint trying to directory discovery some interesting things found
- So after some rough time in the target, arrived to an endpoint that is SPA and the source map is open for next few (or even much) days We will stuck in here :)
