- for today after arrive to a CIDR so we trying to find other up servers that maybe interesting.
- write down all IP addresses and now, if you remember we arrive to a CIDR that gave us some interesting data line ASNumber and Organization name so let's find more assets.
    - we can found some other CIDRs so this increase attack surface for us.
- wide recon in this program not too fit, back to application mapping
- it's toooooooo hard to get feeling on program, and this application is noisy for me, but the key of progress is consistency
    
Greats!
