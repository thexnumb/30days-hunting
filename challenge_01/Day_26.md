# Day26 `23-Jan-2025`
- Hello there welcome to another day of this challenge.
- As you remember yesterday we goes to another domain that were develop with `Next.js` so in here we should completely deep into it.
- First step is to work with the target and be familiar with funcionalities.
- For the tons of time again I'll tell the steps:
    - Walkthrough like normal user while see the traffic of the application via `Burpsuite Proxy`
    - found an asset that redirect to another endpoint so best practive in here to find some hidden file or endpoints
    - in this endpoint some behaviors detected, normal request send get 200, add parameter and send get `200` and Cache `miss` then change the request headers and get back `400`, now maybe we can found some interesting  in here.
