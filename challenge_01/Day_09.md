# Day9 `29-Dec-2024`
- for today still stuck in `waybackurls` in deep.
    - for more understanding what is the concept of use web archiive?
        - for finding hidden parameters or urls that we can't find in normal ways
        - simplest way find for `&`
        - arrive to some interesting endpoint that leads to maybe some important js files, let's read JS :)
        - this JS reading not helpful 
        - so goes and still look the urls
        - some interesting paths shows up
            - in a specific url path contains UUID, click on it and Boom there were some information about Agencies that don't exist in another place or even linked. so I've will report it as `Information Disclosure`
Greats!
