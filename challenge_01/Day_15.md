# Day15 `06-Jan-2025`
- start fresh, which means start again and goes forward with the methodology.
- Start wide recon again, and copare with previous concepts
    - trying to increase attack surface with find other assets.
    - so at the first trying to know the backbone of the application
- note that alongside of doing wide and while commands getting run, now go the main domains and start test from the where we stop.
- Oops! the application block me from the base, ...

Trying to bypass but I don't even know how to block me, after change some important headers in my request. I think our journey with this application end, least for now!
before goes to another application, I know that I've act that is unfit with the application policy, and I don't wanna to fall into the rabbit hole, so it's better passed this situation. so in this step I'll show you the brief of this 15 days working on this program. this is a review:
| Total Days | Total Time Spent | No. of Found Bugs |

- Now w'll we going to find another application
- the application found 
- write down scope 
- weaponize the burp for that 
- before web application mapping best way to get into the application is wide recon, so this flow is applied:
    - Subdomain discovery
    - DNS resolution on those subs
    - Service Discovery on rusults of the DNS resolution
- another flow applied in wide that is 
    - search domains on shodan, and then arrive to the server IP address
    - so when we have IP address bunch of works can approved
        - whois IP address the IP is own by the company, it's great that may leads us to the faraway place :) 
        - do port scan on the IP
- Again meanwhile doing some basic works like act and browse like normal user.

Greats!
