# Day22 `18-Jan-2025`
- Hello Every one in this session I'm going to continue the steps we stuck earlier.
- Let's work on the new asset that we found earlier day and we need to verify that.
- Let's do some wide recon on the new asset.
    - Sub Enum
        - for multiple time let's describe the enum process
            - Subfinder
            - Abuseipdb
            - Chaos
            - Crtsh
            - gau
            - subcenter
            - waybackurl
       - these provider is easy to use and commands are easy too.
- so earlier just use subfinder but now with more providers maybe we access to more assets...
- let's check services on the live subdomains.
- Arrive to an endpoint that is an API for login and it's great place for fuzz
- nothing found
It's good for today, hope tomorrow will be ok.
