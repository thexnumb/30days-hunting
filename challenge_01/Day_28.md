# Day28 `27-Jan-2025`
- Hello everyone, today I'm going to work on the main domain of the application
- first of all click on every single links that exist in the page
- after that If nothing found goes to the Web Archive and then trying to check each url and see the response for each one.
- arrive to some api, best way to work with then at the first place is to do fuzz on the route
- On the web archive too many domains and subdomains exist that are interesting.
- I think it's enough for today.
