# Day29 `10-Feb-2025`
- Hello there, after a long Hibernation, I'm back to complete this challenge with some modifications:
    - First I change the platform from H1 to BugCrowd, so the program changed too.
    - I these two left days "Just Application mapping, and Crawling Should be applied"
- So let's go (Sorry for the failure ;] )
- Fist read the policy of the program carefully(for the first time I'll do it)
- Write down all in-scope assets
- and find out Out-of-Scope assets
- act like a normal user!
- In meanwhile of act like normal user found a URL that is Basic Credentials, so we can do bruteforce some test done in here like:
    -  Check for Default or Weak Credentials
    -  Try to Bypass Authentication
- Nothing happen.
