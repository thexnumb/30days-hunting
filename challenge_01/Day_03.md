# Day3 `22-Dec-2024`
- Continue working and walking through the application like a normal user
    - note that if in any feature we work on and make a sense to test some simple things, then it is good to do that.
    - best way to dealing with application while we are in the act like normal user is that to create a mindmap, it's a miracle!
    - do multi work will save time, like subdomain domain or anythings that we need to enum it is better to do automaically and spent our main focus on the application behavior or so.
    - in login process we faced with JWT token, so in here too we should feel some sense about it, because implementation of that may be vulnerable.
        - use jwt_tool and  hashcat and common jwt secrets but no result!
    - write down login mechanism in xmind and then
    - meanwhile do some wide recon maybe helpful!
