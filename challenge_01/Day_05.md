- check each result of service discovery for find any low hanging fruits!
    - I prefer to check for `403` status code
    - second place to check is `3xx` status code
        - I've been arrive to an endpoint that show Up `401` status code
        - trying to change the url endpoint and boom, that leads to infinite Redirect loop, let's go to report it.
- for tommorow I have another endpoint then first work on it then go to the rest.
