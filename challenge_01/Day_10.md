# Day10 `30-Dec-2024`
- For today still stuck in `waybackurl`
    - done for all domains. some interesting endpoints found. but still nothing.
- in this step now go back to the found interesing endpoints and take deeper look at them.
- note that this maybe takes few days but I'll trying to share all jobs I've done.

It's ok for today, the rest of the day will be spend to learn more and more about penetration testing and hunting and reading good write-ups.

Greats!
